            <h3>For my map, I decided to decided to focus on the state of California and their counties. Originally, I had wanted to look at the amount of parks per county but I was having a lot of trouble finding data that would work well for this. So ultimately after a few failed searches, I ended up on a California open data source and found a large CSV file for number of Hospitalizations due to Asthma per county. I cleaned up the data by getting rid of all of the information and I did not need. I then joined this to my CA county shapefile in QGIS.</h3>
