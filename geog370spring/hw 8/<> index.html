            <h1>Homework 8: Census data ratios and categories  </h1>
            <h2>Madison Findley</h2>
            <h3>For my ratio, I focused on the ratio of the amount of people over six enrolled in school to the whole population of New Jersey. To create the ratio, I went to the attribute table and clicked on the open field calculator. Once there, I went to the values option on the side and divided my enrollment data by the total population data. After doing this in attribute table, I multipled the data by 100 so it is per 100 people. Overall, I think that the classification category that should be used varies depending on the data. I have explained sitatuions under each map that give examples. </h3>

                <h4> The first category that I decided to do was natural breaks. This category is used to classify values on natural groups that already are within the data. So this means that the groups may not be equal since there is no emphasis on that. The groups are just made where breaks naturally occur within the data. This can be helpful because it works with the natural pattern of the data, but this can completely elimate groups if there is no data in that range and a natural break occurs there.</h4>

                <h5> The second category I picked was equal count or quantile. This classification creates groups with equal number of values in each group. It's main focus is making sure that each group has an equal number of values or data points. The big issue with this classification is that if the data is not distributed very evenly, it can lead to misleading maps. It can possibly over or under represent certain areas and populations.</h5>

                <h6> The final category I decided to work with was equal interval. This classification essentially breaks the data up into groups by the number of desired groups and then having each group span an specific number of values across a number line. This happens to work well with continous data. A good example would be temperature.</h6>
