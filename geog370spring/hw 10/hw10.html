            <h3>For my map, I decided to look at my home town of Fuquay Varina, NC. I wanted to answer the question if there would be any possible polluted rivers/streams because of new developments that are proposed. To do this, I went to Fuquay Varina's open data source and downloaded a streams/rivers shapefile and a proposed development shapefile. I first did an intersection of the rivers with the proposed developments to see where there was overlap of the two. Next, I added a 50 foot buffer to each of the rivers/streams that were within the intersection. This answered my question that there could be possible polluted rivers because of the developments proposed.</h3>
