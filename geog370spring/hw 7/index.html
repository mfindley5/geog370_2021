            <h3>For my map, I decided to focus on New Jersey since that is where I am from. For the catergory, I chose to go with education and downloaded a file with many stats about their education. I decided to focus on the number of people age three or older in NJ who are enrolled in school. The darker the shade of purple the county is, the more people over the age of three they have enrolled in school.</h3>
